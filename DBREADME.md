# Data Bank Contract Documentation

## Overview

The Data Bank contract is a fundamental component in our Trust and Verification System, residing in the verification layer. It is responsible for hashing and securely storing data on the Merkle tree, ensuring data integrity and providing a verifiable record of information within the ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction

The Data Bank contract is designed to securely store hashed data, creating a tamper-resistant record on the Merkle tree. Its integration within the verification layer ensures that users can trust and verify the data they interact with in the ecosystem.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Secure Data Storage

The contract securely stores data by hashing it and placing it on the Merkle tree. This guarantees the integrity of the stored information and provides users with a reliable reference for verification.

### 2.2 Merkle Tree Integration

Data is organized on a Merkle tree, enabling efficient verification and retrieval of stored information. The Merkle tree structure enhances the scalability and integrity of the data storage mechanism.

### 2.3 Decentralized Verification

Users can independently verify the integrity of stored data using the Merkle tree. This decentralized verification process ensures transparency and trust within the ecosystem.

## 3. Data Storage Mechanism

The Data Bank contract uses a Merkle tree structure to organize and store hashed data. Each piece of data is hashed, and the resulting hash is stored on a leaf node of the Merkle tree. The root of the tree represents the combined hash of all stored data, providing a verifiable anchor point.

## 4. Smart Contract Functions

### 4.1 storeData(bytes32 dataHash)

Stores a hashed piece of data on the Merkle tree. Users can submit data hashes for secure storage.

### 4.2 retrieveData(bytes32 dataHash)

Retrieves the original data associated with a specific data hash from the Merkle tree. This function facilitates data retrieval for verification purposes.

## 5. Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the Data Bank contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the Data Bank contract on the desired blockchain network (e.g., Binance Smart Chain or Polygon).

2. Interact with the contract using the provided functions through a web3-enabled application or script.

3. Users can store and retrieve data securely, leveraging the Merkle tree for decentralized verification.

## 6. JavaScript Integration

### 6.1 Storing Data

```javascript
// JavaScript code snippet to store hashed data
const dataHash = "0xabc123..."; // Replace with the actual hashed data
await dataBankContract.storeData(dataHash, { from: userWallet });

// JavaScript code snippet to retrieve original data
const dataHashToRetrieve = "0xabc123..."; // Replace with the data hash to retrieve
const originalData = await dataBankContract.retrieveData(dataHashToRetrieve, { from: userWallet });
console.log("Original Data:", originalData);

7. Security Considerations
Ensure that the Data Bank contract is deployed from a secure and audited environment.

Implement proper access controls to manage data storage and retrieval.

Periodically review and update the contract to address potential vulnerabilities and improve security.

Use reputable development tools and frameworks to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.
